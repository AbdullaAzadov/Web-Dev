        <p>The <em>Cheetah</em> is awesome because <strong>It is the fastest land animal, capable of running at 93 to 104 km/h. It has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail. The cheetah was first described in the late 18th century</strong>.</p>
