        <h1>Sonnet 18</h1>
        <h3>What about?</h3>
        <p>In "Sonnet 18", the speaker compares a young man, the fair youth, to both the beauty and the impermanence of a summer's day.
            <br>Like summertime, the young man is resplendent with "darling buds" and "gold complexion"; however, the speaker notes, he is actually "more lovely" than a summer's day.
